*/ Airline_Reviews Dataset anaylized by Dava Betts on 7/26/23
Obtained from Kaggle.com
Goal: Find out which United States Mainline Carriers rank at the top in the year 2022 with overall score and wifi rating./*

*/ This dataset included airlines from all over the world with 22 Columns in the table. To begin I narrowed down my results with the top 3 mainline 
carriers and excluded any results that did not list the aircraft type./*

SELECT AirlineName, OriginCountry, Aircraft 
FROM Airline_Reviews
WHERE OriginCountry = 'UnitedStates'
  AND (AirlineName LIKE 'Delta%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'American Airlines%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'United Airlines%')
  AND Aircraft IS NOT NULL;
  
*/ The "IS NOT NULL" operator failed possilby due to leading or trailing spaces. To eliminate this problem I used the TRIM()
function below./*

SELECT AirlineName, OriginCountry, TRIM(Aircraft) AS Aircraft
FROM Airline_Reviews
WHERE OriginCountry = 'UnitedStates'
  AND (AirlineName LIKE 'Delta%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'American Airlines%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'United Airlines%')
  AND TRIM(Aircraft) <> '';
  
SELECT AirlineName, OriginCountry, TRIM(Aircraft) AS Aircraft, MAX(OverallScore) AS OverallScore, MAX(WifiRating) AS WifiRating, MAX(DateFlown) AS DateFlown
FROM Airline_Reviews
WHERE OriginCountry = 'UnitedStates'
  AND (AirlineName LIKE 'Delta%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'American Airlines%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'United Airlines%')
  AND COALESCE(Aircraft, '') <> ''
GROUP BY AirlineName, OriginCountry, Aircraft
HAVING MAX(DateFlown) LIKE '%2022'
ORDER BY MAX(OverallScore) DESC, MAX(DateFlown) DESC
LIMIT 18;

*/ In the final query I wanted to narrow the results down to the year of 2022. After running the query for that year I noticed only 18 results were ruturned and 
added which columns I wanted to focus on which were the OverallScore and Wifirating. It appears from the data returned that American Airlines and Delta Air Lines out rank
United in both categories leading with 9's and 5's./*
