/* Airline_Reviews Dataset analyzed by Dava Betts on 7/26/23
Obtained from Kaggle.com
Goal: Find out which United States Mainline Carriers rank at the top in 2022 with an overall score and wifi rating.*/

/* This dataset included airlines from all over the world with 22 Columns in the table. First, I narrowed down my results with the top 3 mainline 
carriers and excluded any results that did not list the aircraft type.*/

SELECT AirlineName, OriginCountry, Aircraft 
FROM Airline_Reviews
WHERE OriginCountry = 'UnitedStates'
  AND (AirlineName LIKE 'Delta%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'American Airlines%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'United Airlines%')
  AND Aircraft IS NOT NULL;
  
/* The "IS NOT NULL" operator failed, possibly due to leading or trailing spaces. To eliminate this problem, I used the TRIM()
function below.*/

SELECT AirlineName, OriginCountry, TRIM(Aircraft) AS Aircraft
FROM Airline_Reviews
WHERE OriginCountry = 'UnitedStates'
  AND (AirlineName LIKE 'Delta%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'American Airlines%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'United Airlines%')
  AND TRIM(Aircraft) <> '';
  
SELECT AirlineName, OriginCountry, TRIM(Aircraft) AS Aircraft, MAX(OverallScore) AS OverallScore, MAX(WifiRating) AS WifiRating, MAX(DateFlown) AS DateFlown
FROM Airline_Reviews
WHERE OriginCountry = 'UnitedStates'
  AND (AirlineName LIKE 'Delta%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'American Airlines%' OR AirlineName LIKE 'United Airlines%')
  AND COALESCE(Aircraft, '') <> ''
GROUP BY AirlineName, OriginCountry, Aircraft
HAVING MAX(DateFlown) LIKE '%2022'
ORDER BY MAX(OverallScore) DESC, MAX(DateFlown) DESC
LIMIT 18;

/* In the final query, I wanted to narrow the results to 2022. After running the query for that year, I noticed only 18 results were returned and 
added which columns I wanted to focus on: the OverallScore and Wifirating. It appears from the data returned that American Airlines and Delta Air Lines out rank
United in both categories is leading with 9's and 5's.*/
